                    <h2>KYWY - The Vision </h2>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Joe, the CEO of Koinslot and the visionary behind the Kywy project. My journey with
                        Kywy began during an underwhelming experience with a high-priced, lackluster AAA game. This
                        moment of dissatisfaction with the current gaming market sparked a desire in me to recapture the
                        essence of early PC games and classic handhelds like the Gameboy and DS. These iconic devices,
                        with their limited resources, managed to deliver games that ignited imagination and wonder. My
                        goal with Kywy is to revive the spirit of handheld, tactile gaming devices, blending modern
                        features and processors with the simplicity and charm of a small, keychain-sized gadget. Kywy is
                        designed to inspire the creation of simple yet powerfully imaginative games.</p>

                    <p>As a lifelong maker and gamer, I've always been fascinated by the inner workings of technology.
                        I've disassembled nearly every device I've owned, and now, I want to extend that same sense of
                        exploration and discovery to you. Kywy is more than just a gaming device; it's an open canvas
                        for creativity. It's built to be reprogrammed, disassembled, repaired, and repurposed. We
                        encourage you to tinker with Kywy and unleash your technical creativity.</p>

                    <h3>Empowering Education with Kywy</h3>

                    <p>Education is another cornerstone of the Kywy philosophy. My past experience with an educational
                        company, focusing on bringing learning opportunities to underprivileged and underrepresented
                        communities, highlighted a significant need. I envisioned a device that could reach those
                        without internet access or abundant resources but who harbored a strong desire to learn
                        programming and express their technical creativity. Kywy is that device. It's an affordable
                        gateway for anyone to create and share games, even for those who might not have access to a
                        modern computer.</p>

                    <p>Kywy is more than just a gaming device; it's a tool for learning, creating, and sharing. It's
                        about empowering the next generation of gamers and developers, regardless of their background or
                        resources. Join us on this exciting journey to redefine handheld gaming and unlock the potential
                        of creative minds everywhere.</p>

                    <p>Stay tuned for more updates on Kywy, and feel free to share your thoughts and ideas with us.
                        Together, let's build a community where gaming and creativity thrive.</p>

                    <p>Best,<br>Joe</p>

                    <span class="post-author">By Erik Lutz</span>
                    <h2>The Kywy Engine</h2>

                    <p>One of the core components driving our platform's capabilities is the open-source Kywy game
                        engine. While it's still in its early alpha stage, our primary focus has been on simplicity and
                        accessibility, ensuring that even those without extensive programming experience can use it
                        effectively.</p>

                    <p>In this inaugural software blog post, we'll delve into some of the major components of the Kywy
                        engine that we've already implemented. These components play a crucial role in testing the
                        engine and creating the engaging scenes you've seen on our social media.</p>

                    <h3>Multitasking, Game Clock, and Inputs</h3>

                    <p>The Kywy engine follows the "Actor Model," where distinct "actors" run concurrently and
                        communicate through messages. For example, our game clock operates as an actor, regularly
                        sending out TICK messages. Additionally, we have an actor responsible for monitoring button
                        presses and dispatching messages to other actors when buttons are pressed or released.</p>

                    <p>But that's just the beginning. You have the freedom to create your own actors to manage various
                        aspects of your game. Imagine crafting an actor to control your player character. By subscribing
                        it to the engine clock, you can have it perform actions on every TICK, such as updating
                        animations. You can also link it to the engine's input actor to respond to button presses,
                        allowing players to trigger character actions effortlessly.</p>

                    <p>Actors are at the heart of your game's architecture: controlling characters, backgrounds, menus,
                        game loops, and more. The engine handles concurrency automatically, leaving you to set up your
                        actors and set them in motion!</p>

                    <h2>Graphics</h2>

                    <p>To ensure exceptional performance, we've developed a custom screen driver for the Kywy hardware.
                        Our testing revealed that other open-source graphics libraries, such as <a
                            href="https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2">u8g2</a>, achieved a limited 20-30 FPS on our
                        hardware. However, with our proprietary library, we achieved an impressive 400+ FPS!</p>

                    <p>Building upon our core graphics library, we've introduced a sprite system that simplifies the
                        management and display of various components in your game. You can load sprite sheets, render
                        sprites, manipulate their positions, and even create animations.</p>

                    <h2>State Machines</h2>

                    <p>Managing game state, especially in more complex games, can be challenging. To address this, we've
                        created a state machine library that's at your disposal. With this tool, you can define
                        self-contained components with well-defined states and transitions that dictate how data should
                        change in response to specific events. By connecting these states and even nesting them, you can
                        construct intricate behaviors from simple components.</p>

                    <h2>What's Coming Next?</h2>

                    <p>While our engine is still a work in progress, it already possesses the functionality to build
                        moderately complex games. We plan to showcase this capability as part of our upcoming
                        Kickstarter campaign, so stay tuned! Our primary focus moving forward is to enhance usability,
                        documentation, and tutorials. We're committed to making everything from installation to flashing
                        your first game accessible, even for those with limited programming experience. Over the next
                        few months, we'll be smoothing the path to developing Kywy games.</p>

                    <p>We're thrilled about the journey ahead and can't wait to share it with you. The Kywy engine is a
                        significant step toward bringing your gaming ideas to life, and we're dedicated to making that
                        process as enjoyable and straightforward as possible.</p>
